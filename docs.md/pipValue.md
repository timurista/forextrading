## Losses and Forex risks
Pips and Lots determines pip value
not function of currency pare
number pips has moved and volume of transaction

1.23228

25 pips
1.23478

LOts = 0.1
Lots = 5.0 means you have 5 times as much value

## Pip value
value = lots x 1000 base currency at base 1

value = 1.0 * 100,000 (EUR) x 1.23228 (USD/EUR)
pip value = 250(USD) / 25(Pips) = $10 (USD/Pip)

= lots * 10 * delta_pips
in units of quoted currency

= lots * 10
**pip value = lots * 10**

this means that if your currency moves some pips, then value of every pip.

1 lot every time it moves 1 time you earn 10 dollars. 

Calculate risks
Risk (amount we can close) = StopLoss (50 pips) * pip value
= 500

risk is $500 max you can lose
risk = SLPips * lots * 10

**lots = risk / (SLPips * 10)**

say we are prepared to risk $50
we can derive amount of lots we need.

Control risks by knowing how much prepared to lose.
Confidence in signals, whether trading with trend.

Think of how much you want to lose
then where you are setting stop loss
